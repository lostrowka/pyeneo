# pyeneo

**pyeneo** is a state-of-the-art Ceneo.pl handler written in **Python 3** as a project for **Software Engineering** 
class at AGH University of Science and Technology by:

* Łukasz Ostrówka,
* Maciej Kania,
* Maciej Jankowski.

## Running the application
   1. With CLI 
         
         ```sudo su <br/>
         apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y  
         apt-get install python3.7 -y
         apt-get install git-all -y
         mkdir io
         cd io
         git clone https://github.com/lostrowka/pyeneo.git
         apt-get install python3-venv
         python3.7 -m venv my_env
         source my_env/bin/activate
         cd pyeneo
         python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
         export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
         python server/website manage.py runserver
         ```
         
         (included in bash file start.sh)
         
   2. With IntelliJ IDEA
      
      ![IDEA config](https://github.com/lostrowka/pyeneo/blob/master/images/idea_config.png)
      
This should print a URL pointing to http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default. Clicking it will redirect you to the application site.

# Implementation Details

## Data Structures

### Offer
Offer is a class containing single offer for a specific product. Fields are self-explanatory.

### ItemQuery
Class reflecting a search bar entry in the service. Consists of following fields with pretty much self-explanatory 
names:
* name: str = ""
* quantity: float = 0
* min_price: float = 0
* max_price: float = 0
* timestamp: str = None

ItemQuery has create_url method providing URL for website with according search results.
Apart from that this class has methods to validate entered prices for example, convert commas with dots (as decimal 
separators).

### Item
Class reflecting a specific item as returned in Ceneo search results. Fields:
* prod_id: str = ""
* parent_item_query: ItemQuery = None
* offers: List[Offer] = []
* mean_price: float = None

Item has method create_url similar to one implemented in ItemQuery.
get_price_by_seller returns either price for given seller or -1 if there is no such seller. This feature is used to 
find sellers with all desired items later on.

Item has two Offer related methods, one returning best Offer chosen by lowest price.
The other is used to get a desired Offer by its name, it returns None if no such Offer was found.

### Seller
It's an intermediate data structure used to facilitate multiple items processing. It consists of following fields.
* name: str -- seller name
* stock: List[Dict] -- List of Dictionaries with following keys:
    * 'item' -- Item object
    * 'offer' -- Offer given Seller has for this Item. None if there's no such offer.
    * 'price'
Deals are created based on this data.

### Deal
Deal is a structure bind Item to a suggested Offer.

## Data Flow

![Data flow chart](https://github.com/lostrowka/pyeneo/blob/master/images/data_flow.png)


## Data Processing

### CeneoAPIHandler
This class is managing HTTP requests sent to Ceneo, logging included.

send_search_request method takes an ItemQuery as input and returns an HTTP response with according HTML.

send_product_request operates in the same manner but with a specific Item as input. This method is used to get 
details about specific offers.

### SearchResultsProcessor
SearchResultsProcessor is a HTML parser based on BeautifulSoup. It accepts a HTML document and corresponding 
ItemQuery. It is supposed to extract a desired Item or raise an Exception if there is no such Item.

### ProductOffersProcessor
ProductOffersProcessor is a similar HTML parser but for an Item. It provides a List of offers for a given Item.
It has several self-explanatory helper methods to get values such as prices, rating and number of opinions.

### MultipleItemsProcessor
MultipleItemsProcessor operates on a List of Items (each with at least one Offer) to find either the best Deal or at
 least the "best effort" one. "Best effort" meaning each Item is paired with its best Offer.
 
Procedure:
1. Extract a Set of seller names from List of Items.
2. Create a List of Seller objects, each with according stock. 
3. Iterate over Sellers and assemble a Deal for each.
    If a given Seller has an Item, append it to the Deal. If not, then append the Offer with the lowest price.
4. Sort obtained Deals by total price.
5. Return sorted Deals.
